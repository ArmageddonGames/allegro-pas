  This document explains how to install Allegro in GNU/Linux operating systems.
  For Windows operating systems read "windows.txt".

  First you must install Allegro itself.  Current Allegro.pas version is
  compatible with version 5.2.x only so DON'T install version 5.1.x or older.

Installing from repositories
----------------------------

  Most modern GNU/Linux distributions includes Allegro in their on-line
  repositories.  So I recommend a lot to use them instead of download and
  install by hand (anyway you can try that too, as it is quite educative
  and you can learn a lot about how things actually works).

  Note that most "Software Centers" (such as Ubutu's one) lists libraries only,
  so you may need another application to do that.  Try to install "synaptic",
  a well known package manager that works with both DEB and RPM package system.
  You can also use command line programs (apt, rpm, dpkg...) for such
  opperations.

  For example, using aptitude in a console to see if Allegro is available:

$ aptitude search allegro

  Now, to install Allegro 5:

$ sudo aptitude install allegro5-doc allegro5-dev

  See the use of "sudo" and that we install the "-dev" version.



Installing from sources
-----------------------

  Visit Allegro's project website at http://liballeg.org/ and download it.  The
  package includes full installation instructions.  Since you're using an
  actual operating system you can say you don't need to install any extra tool,
  except may be some development libraries.

  For better results, compile and install both "release" an "debug" versions of
  the library.
