  This document explains how to install Allegro in Windows operating systems.
  For GNU/Linux operating systems read "linux.txt".

  First you must install Allegro itself.  Current Allegro.pas version is
  compatible with version 5.2.x only so DON'T install version 5.1.x or older.

Installing precompiled version
------------------------------

  Go to https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/releases and search for the
  desired version.  There you'll find links to the actual download sites.  To
  find wich one is the best for you, think you'll need a "dynamic" version and
  that "x86" is 32bits while "i686" is 64bits.

  Once downloaded, you need only the DLL files in the "bin" subdirectory.  Also
  note that this version of Allegro.pas doesn't work with the "monolyth"
  version of the library.

  In most cases you can put the DLL files in to your "C:\windows\system32"
  directory.



Installing from sources
-----------------------

  First you'll need a C/C++ compiler.  I recommend the MinGW, but you may use
  Visual Studio as well.

  Visit Allegro's project website at http://liballeg.org/ and download it.  The
  package includes full installation instructions.  Follow them.

  For better results, compile and install both "release" an "debug" versions of
  the library.
