  Since Allegro works on MacOS systems, Allegro.pas should too.
  Unfortunatelly I have not a working MacOS system so I have no way to test it.
  Anyway, it should be quite strightforward.

  If you're brave enough, here you have some advices that should help:

  Download and install Allegro in your system.  Allegro includes all
  explanations you'll need and you may ask at the forums or the mailing lists.
  Visit http://liballeg.org for downloading and more information.

  Now, if you try to compile any of the Allegro.pas examples you should see the
  next error message:

  ** Allegro.pas wasn't tested with this Operating System.  Do you want to help?

  So, to make it work you should do some changes in Allegro.pas by yourself:

  * Open file "lib/allegro5.cfg" and add MacOS of supported operating systems at
    the end of the file (you'll see both Windows and Linux there).
  * Copy either "lib/al5_win.cfg" or "lib/al5_unix.cfg" and name it
    "al5_macos.cfg".
  * Open file "lib/al5base.pas" and edit next lines:

{$IF DEFINED(UNIX)}
  {$INCLUDE al5_unix.inc}
{$ELSEIF DEFINED(LINUX)}
  {$INCLUDE al5_unix.inc}
{$ELSEIF DEFINED(WINDOWS)}
  {$INCLUDE al5_win.inc}
{$ELSEIF DEFINED(DARWIN)}
  {$INCLUDE al5_macos.inc}
{$ENDIF}

  * Open that new "al5_macos.cfg" and modify it so _A5_LIB_PREFIX_ and
    _A5_LIB_EXT_ so they can be used to identify the appropriate dylib files.
    See how such constants are used at file al5base.pas.
  * Cross fingers and compile.

  If it doesn't work may be you should change some of the data types declared
  at al5base.pas.  Also you may need to change files "fpc.cfg" or "dcc.cfg"
  (depending on the compiler you're using) to make it work.

  As I've said, I haven't a working MacOS system to test, so I can't help more.
  If you can, let me know.
