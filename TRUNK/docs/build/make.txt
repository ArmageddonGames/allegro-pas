  Before to build Allegro.pas you must install Allegro itself.  If you didn't
  yet, please read the appropriate document for your operating system.

  This document explains how to compile Allegro.pas documentation, examples and
  demonstration game using the "make" tool.  Read "fpc.txt", "lazarus.txt" or
  "delphi.txt" to know how to use such compilers and IDEs.

The make chain
--------------

  This package includes a simple make chain that builds all examples,
  demonstration and documentation from the package:

  - makefile:      the initial make file, it defines several variables to
                   identify directories and set up compiler options.  It also
                   "calls" the other files of the chain.

  - makefile.list: this is an script that searchs and clasifies the source
                   files.

  - makefile.all:  This is where the things actually happens, defining the
                   opeerations needed to build everything.

  "makefile" is the only file you'll need to modify if you want to modify the
  compilation configuration.  That file is quite simple, as it just defines
  some variables/macros (name = value).  The whole file includes a lot of
  comments so it is quite explanatory.  Don't be afraid and take a look to it.

  By default the make chain compiles the examples and the demonstration game
  with simple optimizations.



Compilation
-----------

  To compile examples (with Free Pascal), open a console, go to the directory
  where Allegro.pas is and execute "fix.sh" (on Linux), "fix.bat" or "fix.cmd"
  (on Windows) and follow on-screen instructions to configure.  Then run
  "make".

  To build the documentation, install pasdoc (you can find it here:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/pasdoc/) and run "make docs".
