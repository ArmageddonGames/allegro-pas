(* Code to detect Delphi.

  Seems that old Delphi (i.e: Delphi6) defines DELPHI but newer ones
  doesn't (or at least Tokio 10.2 doesn't) so some tweaking should be done.

  Note that this code was tested with Delphi Tokio 10.2 Starter Edition only.
  I've tryed Delphi 6 proffesional and IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL and I don't see
  how to make it run.  Theoretically it should work with Delphi 7 (as I've
  tryed to keep Cieslak's changes) but I haven't a copy so it isn't tested.

  Also I've used a table from Embarcadero's Delphi Wiki.
