# allegro-pas
Wrapper to use the Allegro game library with Pascal/Delphi.  Synced with official.

Note that the official Allegro.pas wrapper is hosted at SourceForge [http:://allegro-pas.sf.net/].

I'll try to keep this GIT project synchronized with the official one so those people that want to fork it will be able to keep
their branches up-to-date with the latest comminments (as possible).
