Introduction
============

  Allegro.pas is a wrapper to allow Pascal compilers (such as Free Pascal or
  Delphi) to use the Allegro library.

  I wrote it to use it by myself, so I didn't included all functionality of
  Allegro.  Aniway, I'll fix it and complete it as I'm using it (or as other
  users do).  Any collaboration will be wellcomed.

  This version is an SVN version.  It's only for testing and evaluation
  purposes so you shouldn't use it in your actual projects.  May be you can
  use the latest 4.2 release instead.

  Right now Allegro.pas 4.3.0 need a lot of work to be finished.  If you want
  to collaborate please join the main Allegro.pas mailing list
  (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=allegro-pas-main).

  Allegro & Allegro.pas are gift-ware.  They were created by a number of people
  working in cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift.  You may use,
  modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and
  you do not have to give us anything in return.  However, if you like this
  product you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro
  community.  This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful
  bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps just releasing
  the sources of your program so that other people can learn from them.  If you
  redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it would be nice if
  you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you are not required to
  do this.  We trust you not to abuse our generosity.

============
Installation
============

  Download and install Allegro 4.3.10 from http://alleg.sourceforge.net/.  Note
  that this Allegro.pas version will not work with other Allegro than 4.3.10.

  WARNING - Current state was tested on GNU/Linux only.  You might need to
  change unit "albase" to make it work on your operating system.  If you do so
  with success, please let me know through the main Allegro mailing list
  (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=allegro-pas-main).



==========
How to use
==========

  The units are in the subdirectory "lib".

  See the examples in subdirectory "examples".  Compile them using the
  "makefile" at root directori.  WARNING - Some examples just don't work.


  You can create documentation using the pasdoc utility
  (http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/).  There are a "makefile" at the docs
  subdirectory.  Note that English isn't my first language so it may have
  lots of errors and mistakes.  Also some links may be broken.



================
Release programs
================

  Current version isn't for final work so DO NOT RELEASE PROGRAMS USING IT
  unless for evaluation and/or testing purposes.



===========
Help needed
===========

  The curren version is unfinished.  You can help to finish it and add your
  name to the author's list.  We need people to test the library, to complete
  the documentation, to translate it to other languajes or to write more
  wrapper functons, develop demos and examples.

  If you want to help, read the next section and contact me!
