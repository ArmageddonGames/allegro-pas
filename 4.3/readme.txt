Introduction
============

  Allegro.pas is a wrapper to allow Pascal compilers (such as Free Pascal or
  Delphi) to use the Allegro library.

  I wrote it to use it by myself, so I didn't included all functionality of
  Allegro.  Aniway, I'll fix it and complete it as I'm using it (or as other
  users do).  Any collaboration will be wellcomed.

  This version is an SVN version.  It may be unusable.

  Allegro & Allegro.pas are gift-ware.  They were created by a number of people
  working in cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift.  You may use,
  modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and
  you do not have to give us anything in return.  However, if you like this
  product you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro
  community.  This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful
  bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps just releasing
  the sources of your program so that other people can learn from them.  If you
  redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it would be nice if
  you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you are not required to
  do this.  We trust you not to abuse our generosity.

  The curren version is unfinished.  You can help to finish it and add your
  name to the author's list.  We need people to test the library, to complete
  the documentation, to translate it to other languajes or to write more
  wrapper functons, develop demos and examples.

  If you want to help, read the next section and contact me!
