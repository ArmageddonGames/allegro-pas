@section(1 intro Introduction)

  Allegro.pas is a wrapper to allow Pascal compilers (such as Free Pascal or
  Delphi) to use the Allegro library.

  This version is a SVN version.  It has a lot of things that just dosesn't
  work.  Please see @link(objectives section "Objectives") for a brief
  description of the goals.

  If you want to collaborate please join the main Allegro.pas mailing list

    @item(@bold(Make it run on Linux).  Previous versions work only on
      MS-Windows system.  @bold(This goal is complete).  It would be great to
      introduce other systems as MacOS X and others @(and should be easy as
      basis is complete@) but I haven't another system.)
    @item(@bold(Define a new API more Pascal-like).  Previous versions have a
