  This document explains how to use Allegro.pas with Delphi. For Lazarus read
  "lazarus.txt".  For Free Pascal read "fpc.txt".

  Note that you must install Allegro first.  Read "windows.txt" or "linux.txt".

  Also note that Allegro.pas was tested ONLY with Delphi 10.2 Tokio Sarter
  Edition.  We tried to make it compatible with most Delphi versions available
  but if you're using another version it may not work as expected.  You can
  help us to fix any problem by sharing your experience.  See README file to
  know how to contact with developers.

Compiling examples and demonstration game
-----------------------------------------

  There are "delphi" subdirectories in both examples and demonstration
  directories.  Inside there are Delphi projects for each of them.  Load with
  your IDE and just compile.  Executables are dropped at the "~/bin" directory.

  NOTE: All examples compile except ex_fileslice and ex_saw.  All the ones that
	compile run except ex_camera, ex_prim and ex_projection.  I have not
	much experience with Delphi (last one I used was Delphi 6) so I don't
	know how to fix them (yet).

Creating a new game project
---------------------------

  To create a new project using Allegro.pas create a "console" project.  I
  haven't use Allegro.pas along with VCL or Firemonkey so I have no idea ir it
  works or bad things may happen.  Experience with Lazarus (FCL and LCL) says
  that it would not work at all because both use threads and they manage them
  differently.

  All units needed to use Allegro.pas are in the "~/lib" directory.  You'll
  need all "pas", "inc" and "cfg" files.  You can copy such directory to your
  project's one and then add the units to your project.

Differences between Delphi, Free Pascal and Lazarus
---------------------------------------------------

  Note that there are language differences between Delphi and Free Pascal (even
  using Delphi mode) so don't expect that your code is portable through both
  compilers.  See the examples sources to see how I've tried to write code that
  worked in both compilers.

  Also note STRING management may be problematic.  Free Pascal uses UTF-8 by
  default (CHAR) and Delphi uses UTF-16 by default (WIDECHAR).  Allegro expects
  ASCII/UTF-8 by default, so Delphi compiler may warn about text conversions.
  To reduce the warnings and make it less prone to errors use ANSISTRING.  I'll
  work in this issue.

Windows manifest
----------------

  May be you found that your programs may not work, or they do, but a warning
  window appears talking about "Windows execution privileges" or similar.  This
  is because the modern Windows weird permission system.

  To solve this you should add a "manifest" to your programs.  As I've said I
  have few experience with Delphi (and it was Delphi 6!) so I'm not sure how to
  do that.  If you are more experieced, please let me know (see the README file
  to konw how to contact).  Since the manifest is a XML file, may be you can
  use the same one I've created for Free Pascal (read "fpc.txt").
