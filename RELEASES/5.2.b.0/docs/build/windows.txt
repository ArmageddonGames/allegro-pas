  This document explains how to install Allegro in Windows operating systems.
  For GNU/Linux operating systems read "linux.txt".

  First you must install Allegro itself.  Current Allegro.pas version is
  compatible with version 5.2.x only so DON'T install version 5.1.x or older.

  Read "fpc.txt", "lazarus.txt" or "delphi.txt" to know how to use such
  compilers and IDEs.

Installing precompiled version
------------------------------

  Go to http://liballeg.org/download.html#windows, to the "Windows Binaries"
  section, and select one of the given links.  I recommend you the "Allegro 5.2
  binary packages" but you may use any of them.  To find wich one is the best
  for you, think you'll need a "dynamic" version and that "x86" is 32bits while
  "i686" is 64bits.

  Once downloaded, you need only the DLL files that are in the "bin"
  subdirectory.  Also note that this version of Allegro.pas doesn't work with
  the "monolyth" version of the library (yet).

  In most cases you can put the DLL files in to your "C:\windows\system32"
  directory but may be better to add these DLL files to the directory where the
  executable is.

Installing from sources
-----------------------

  I recommend you to install from sources at least once in your life as it is
  quite educative and you can learn a lot about how things actually works.

  First you'll need a C/C++ compiler.  I recommend the MinGW, but you may use
  Microsoft Visual Studio as well.

  Visit Allegro's project website at http://liballeg.org/download.html and
  download one of the source releases.  The package includes full installation
  instructions.  Follow them.

  For better results, compile and install both "release" and "debug" versions
  of the library.
